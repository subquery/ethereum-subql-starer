# SubQuery - Ethereum Starter Package

The Starter Package is an example that you can use as a starting point for developing your SubQuery project.

This repo includes all starter projects for Substrate - each under its own repo. The templates are registered [in the templates repo](https://github.com/subquery/templates/blob/main/templates.json).

A SubQuery package defines which data The SubQuery will index from the Substrate blockchain, and how it will store it.
